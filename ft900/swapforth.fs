\ This file contains definitions in high-level Forth for the
\ rest of Swapforth. Many words were already defined in
\ nucleus -- this file fills in the gaps.
\       
\ This file is divided into sections for each word set in ANS
\ Forth.
\
\ The only definitions in this file should be specific to
\ Swapforth FT900.
